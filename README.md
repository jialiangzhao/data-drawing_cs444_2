## Notes

**PLEASE UPDATE THIS README AND REMOVE ANY COMMENTS**

You need to make sure that index.html and style are in the same file, and then open index.html. You will get some yellow pillars and some green pillars. A set of segments, a dashed version of a set of segments. There is a 1/4 circle in a circle. I first draw a circle and add a semicircle with path. My html passed the html5 syntax verification. You must have a css file to get the desired effect and color.
